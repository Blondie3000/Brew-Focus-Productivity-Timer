## ✨ About Brew Focus

**Brew Focus** is a sleek, minimalist productivity timer designed to help you maintain deep work sessions using the renowned **Pomodoro Technique**. It combines the structure of focused work with the simple ritual of taking a break, ensuring you stay refreshed and efficient throughout your day.

The app's design philosophy is centered around a distraction-free experience, allowing you to focus on your task without unnecessary clutter.
